    <content>The color of the researchbenches was too dark after an earlier update that allowed them to be made of different materials. This should now be fixed.
Also, for those who want the old color of the benches they should now show the old color if they are made of Plasteel.

There is also an added option to hide the apparel added by this mod. This will remove the recipes and prevent new apparel from spawning. It will not remove existing apparel.

    <content>Found a way to make the research terminal and the laboratory station count as high tech research-benches. So now they should also be usable for projects that demands the high-tech research-bench.
Hope this helps in some way!
