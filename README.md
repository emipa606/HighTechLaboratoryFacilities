# High Tech Laboratory Facilities (Continued)

New and redesigned laboratory facilities for a more high tech look.
Also an upgraded power armor with helmet to construct and a lab coat to research faster.

Should not be a problem adding to an existing save. If you want to remove it, just disassemble the auxillary research-benches and any built power-armor/lab-coat before you remove it.
Since it changes the high-tech research bench it will probably not work well with other mods that does that.

This is a reupload since the original mod has not been updated from B18.
